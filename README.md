# MacroDebugger
Yet Another Macro-Functions C++ Library for (basic) Debugging Purposes. 

*...YAMFC++L(b)DP?*

## What?
**MacroDebugger** (provisional name, it would be changed as soon as I find something better) is a **C++** macro library for simple debugging functionalities.

It has no advanced services, since we all know that the only useful tool for debugging is _a ton of printing statements_.
Well, **MD** does exactly that: it allows you to print everything you want, in an easier and prettier way.

**MD** uses (almost) only macro functions and does not require to be compiled on its own. Thus, you can just include the `.hpp` files you need and use them directly, without linking or compiling (almost) any source file!

## Why?
This simple library has been developed and used for the first time in 2019, for a University project written in **C** language.
In 2020 I converted the main core in **C++**, in order to use it for my thesis.
At the moment, I'm using this library for a University research project.

I know it's not something incredible or revolutionary, but it worked for me.
By sharing it, I hope it also works for someone else :)
